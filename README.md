# Advent of Code

This repository includes my Python code solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

This is just for the fun of solving the puzzles and is, by no means, perfect or well-optimized code ðŸ˜Š 

If you want to solve the puzzles yourself, *please* do not cheat yourself out of a fun learning experience by copying code!

### Dependencies

* python3

### Running the Solution Scripts

1. Navigate to the desired year directory (currently only 2024 is available).
2. Create a `XX.txt` file populated with your own input obtained from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) where `XX` is the day number. For day 1's input, the txt file should be called `01.txt`.
3. Run the corresponding Python Script with `python3 XX.py` where `XX` is the day. For day 1's script, run `python3 01.py`.
